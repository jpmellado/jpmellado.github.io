### Stratocumulus Clouds

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId2 %}

This video shows the liquid water in two vertical planes (the cloud), and the vertically integrated liquid water at the bottom plane, from direct numerical simulations (DNS) at a Reynolds number 104 (equivalently, 800 m deep boundary layer resolved to 1 m). It illustrates the small-scale mixing at the top of the stratiform cloud that caps the planetary boundary layer. This type of simulations are extremely difficult because too coarse resolutions artificially enhance mixing with the dry and warm air in the free troposphere above the cloud, making the cloud disappear. In fact, this is the first direct numerical simulations of such a problem, reproducing measurements without having to tune the simulations for it. You can find more information in Mellado et al., "DNS and LES for simulating stratocumulus: Better together", J. Adv. Model. Earth Syst., 10, 1421-1438 (2018).

### Water Vapor in the Planetary Boundary Layer

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId1 %}

This video shows a vertical cross-section of the water vapor field from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) at a Reynolds number 104 (equivalent to a 1000 m deep boundary layer resolved to 2 m). It illustrates major characteristics of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in unstable conditions, like it occurs during midday over land. We see how moist surface plumes (greenish color) converge and aggregate into updraft motions, which form the ascending branch of large convection cells. This ascending fluid eventually impinge into the capping inversion at the top of the PBL, entraining dry air from the free troposphere (brownish color) into the PBL. The flow diverge at the top, and converge into the downdraft motions, which form the descending branch of the large convection cells. Through these downdrafts, entrained air can affect properties across all PBL, even near the surface. You can find more information in Mellado et al., "Moisture statistics in free convective boundary layers growing into linearly stratified atmospheres", Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., 143, 2403-2419 (2017).
