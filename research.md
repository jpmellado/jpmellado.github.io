Research interests are:
* Planetary boundary layers, environmental flows, fluid mechanics.
* Turbulent mixing, shear- and buoyancy-driven flows, entrainment.
* Clouds, latent heat effects, micro-physical effects.
* Turbulent reacting flows.
* Computational fluid dynamics, numerical methods, high-performance computing.

Current funded projects:  
* Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and University: Turbulence and large coherent structures in the atmospheric boundary layer: Fundamental aspects for parametrizations of cloud formation and for wind-energy applications.
* NIC project HHH07 at the JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre: Direct Numerical Simulation of Turbulent Mixing in the Planetary Boundary Layer.

Previous funded projects:  
* DFG priority programme 1881 Turbulent Superstructures: Convection Cells in the Planetary Boundary Layer: Origin and Reduced Modeling.
* Max Planck Research Group: Turbulent Mixing Processes in the Earth System.
* DFG priority programme 1276 Metstroem: Analysis and Numerical Simulation of Stratocumulus Clouds.
* DKRZ project 573 at the German Climate Computing Center: Direct Numerical Simulation of Climate Relevant Cloud Mixing Processes.
